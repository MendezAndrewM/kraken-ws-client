# Node Kraken WS
A Node.js client for connecting to [Kraken.com](https://www.kraken.com/)'s [web socket api](https://docs.kraken.com/websockets/#overview). Can be used for real-time updates on prices and trades of crypto currencies as well as to programaticlly place orders to buy/sell.

The websocket client is built as an extension to the [kraken-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kraken-api) package, meaning it can also be used to access Kraken's REST API
